Analysing Survey Data with Pandas and Matplotlib

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook for the workshop I did at pyladies Hamburg in February 2020 (https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/PyLadies-Hamburg/events/268509028/).

Most Survey Data consists of categorical variables like gender or the level of education. In contrast to Stata or SPSS, with Python variable labels, values and value labels are not stored simultaneously in one file. The main focus is therefore on how to label categorical variables and their values with Pandas. Additionally, we will assign sampling weights and show different ways to visualize categorical variables and weighted data with Matplotlib.
The data for this workshop is a poll from the 2016 presidential elections in the United States and provides an insight into the demographics and views of Trump and Clinton voters.

Outline:
Reading STATA/ SPSS files and labels
Handling of categorical variables
Assigning labels to variables and its values
Visualizing categorical variables
Visualizing/ reporting weighted data

It is based on my project Trump vs. Clinton, but focusses more on the topic of Survey Data especially how to handle categorical data and ensure representativeness. At first I give a small intro and go through the notebook. There are two exercises in between to get an instight and better understanding of the data and one in the end.
